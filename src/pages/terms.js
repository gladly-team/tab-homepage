        The Tab for a Cause Team strives to maintain a website that is clear,
        honest, and easy to use.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Below are our Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms") that govern Tab for
        a Cause's relationship with its users and others who interact with
        tab.gladly.io (the "Website") and any information, text, graphics,
        photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the
        Website (collectively referred to as "Content"). This document applies
        to Tab for a Cause ("Tab for a Cause", "us", "our", or "we"), and by
        using the Website in any way, you agree to these Terms in their
        entirety. If you have any questions, please{' '}
        <Link to={contactUsURL}>contact the Tab for a Cause Team</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Payments to Causes</h2>
      <p>
        Tab for a Cause's mission is the payment of advertising revenue
        generated to nonprofit charity organizations ("Cause" or "Causes") that
        users care about. The following terms govern Tab for a Cause's payments
        to Causes:
      </p>
      <p>
        Any "Raised", "Given", and "Earned" dollar amounts are our Team's
        good-faith projections of how much advertising revenue users have earned
        based on their usage of the Tab for a Cause website. Please note that in
        the case that Tab for a Cause does not receive payment from its partners
        for any reason, including but not limited to advertisement click-fraud,
        Tab for a Cause is not responsible for making any payments to Causes and
        reserves the right to modify the displayed dollar amounts accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tab for a Cause's payments to Causes are made within 120 days of the end
        of every fiscal quarter. Any displayed dollar amount "Raised", "Given",
        or "Earned" simply indicates that Tab for a Cause has designated funds
        for payment to a particular cause, and in no way reflects when the cause
        actually receives these funds.
      </p>
      <p>
        All dollar amounts listed on the Website represent United States
        Dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Tab for a Cause makes payments of user-generated funds to the
        causes users designate, all user-generated funds are considered the
        wholly-owned revenue of Tab for a Cause and all payments to Causes are
        considered payments directly from Tab for a Cause to the designated
        Causes. Users have no legal claim to redeem these funds from Tab for a
        Cause, nor any legal claim to exert control over these funds in any way.
        Users must be aware that they may not legally attempt to deduct from
        their taxes any amounts "raised" on Tab for a Cause and that to do so
        may be illegal in the user's tax jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Selection and Continuance of Causes</h2>
      <p>
        Causes that operate on the Website are selected based on whether they:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          are geographically broad in scope (for example, national or
          international in scope)
        </li>
        <li>
          are 501(c)(3) organizations maintain accessible and transparent
          financial statements
        </li>
        <li>
          are top-rated for efficiency by a third-party Cause evaluator (for
          example, rated 3 or 4 stars on CauseNavigator.org). We may relax this
          criterion in some situations, such as when the Cause has not yet been
          evaluated by third-party evaluators.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tab for a Cause reserves all rights to choose the Causes that are to
        operate on the Website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tab for a Cause reserves the right to remove a Cause from its website or
        discontinue all payments to a Cause at any time and without reason. In
        such a case, Tab for a Cause will evenly distribute that Cause's unpaid
        earnings to all other Causes on the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        If at any time the administration of a Cause for which Tab for a Cause
        raises revenue requests that Tab for a Cause remove the Cause from the
        Website or discontinue all payments to said Cause, Tab for a Cause will
        comply within fourteen (14) days from the date of receiving a written
        request from a verifiable member of the Cause's administration. In such
        a case, Tab for a Cause will evenly distribute that Cause's unpaid
        earnings to all other Causes on the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        By listing a Cause on its website or raising revenue for a Cause, Tab
        for a Cause does not necessarily imply any formal relationship with that
        Cause. Tab for a Cause is not operated by any members of administration
        from the Causes listed on the Website.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Reproduction and Display of Content</h2>
      <p>
        Tab for a Cause, to the best of its knowledge, does not reproduce or
        display any content to which Tab for a Cause does not have the right to
        reproduce or display.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any photos or written content reproduced from other sources are photos
        or written content that were explicity licensed with a Creative Commons
        license for commercial use at the time of their obtainment.
      </p>
      <p>
        All users must agree to owning all rights to their submitted content and
        give Tab for a Cause the right to reproduce and display that content on
        the website and in all marketing material. User-submitted content is
        reproduced and displayed on good faith that the user who submitted the
        content owned all rights to the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        If at any time a the owner of any content reproduced or displayed on the
        Website requests that the owner's content be removed from the Website,
        Tab for a Cause will comply with that request within fourteen (14) days
        of receiving the request. Tab for a Cause may require evidence of the
        user's ownership of the material prior to complying with the request.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Referral Program</h2>
      <p>
        For the Referral Program, Tab for a Cause will distribute "Referral
        Links" to the Tab for a Cause community. A "Referral Link" is a unique
        url for you to distribute to eligible friends, family and other third
        parties (each, a "Referred User"). If a Referred User uses your Referral
        Link to sign up and become a user of Tab for a Cause, then the Referred
        User shall be considered a "Qualifying User" and you will be eligible
        for the referral reward. Tab for a Cause will at its sole discretion
        determine which Referred Users are approved as Qualifying Users on Tab
        for a Cause.
      </p>

      <div style={{ marginLeft: indentationPx }}>
        <h2>A. Sharing Referral Links</h2>
        <p>

          purposes, and only shared with personal connections that will
