Every time you open a new tab, there will be two small ads in the right corner of your home screen. Companies pay for this space to advertise on our platform, and from there we can put that money to good use by giving it back to an organization doing great work for our furry friends. Tab for Cats is absolutely free for our users, and a great way to make an impact without breaking the bank."
