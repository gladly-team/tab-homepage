            "question": "Does the money raised only support specific disasters?",
            "answer": "No. The money raised by Tab for Disaster Relief will go to where WCK and Direct Relief feel it will be most impactful. This is because often, the organizations need money not limited to specific disasters to be prepared and able to respond quickly. For instance, both organizations will strategically place resources and volunteers near incoming hurricanes days before the storm lands to ensure they are ready to respond as soon as it is safe. <br /> The reality is that the majority of donations to disaster relief organizations happen in the immediate days following the disaster, well after the money has its most impactful use (being prepared and on the ground before the disaster strikes). We want to help these organizations be ready to respond quickly to unforeseen events."
