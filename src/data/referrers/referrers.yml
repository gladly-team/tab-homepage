# Do not modify existing referrers that have been shared
# publicly. The "path" key sets the URL path, so avoid
# generic names that we might want to use for our own pages,
# like "team", "youtube", "charity", etc.
# If a path is not provided, a vanity URL page will not be
# created, but that referrer can still use a link with the "r"
# URL parameter set to its referrer ID.
